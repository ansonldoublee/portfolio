            <p>Before I even start designing, it’s always important to first understand the problem and ask the team as many questions as possible. This may include questions about our objective, scope, who we’re designing for, tech constraints and timelines. Clear communication will save us a lot of time in the long-run!</p>

                        <p>A: Research has shown that 77% of marketers want to use AI to reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks and 62% of consumers are comfortable with generative AI, as long it doesn’t negatively impact their experience. We hypothesise that this feature will give us a competitive edge for new users to increase conversions, user retention and upgrade to our premium plans.</p>
